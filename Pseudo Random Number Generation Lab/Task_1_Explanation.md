# 128-bit Encryption Key Generator in Python
This project demonstrates how to generate a 128-bit encryption key using Python's random module and highlights the importance of seeding in pseudo-random number generation.

# Overview
Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) require a seed to produce random numbers. This program explores two scenarios:

* Using the current time as a seed to initialize the random number generator.
* Not using a seed, letting the default system mechanism handle it.
* The program generates a 16-byte (128-bit) encryption key and prints it in hexadecimal format for readability.

# Code Explanation
### Libraries Used
* time: Retrieves the current time in seconds since the Epoch for seeding.
* random: Generates pseudo-random numbers.
### Constants
* KEYSIZE: Defines the key size as 16 bytes (128 bits).
### Program Workflow
#### Case 1: Using a Seed

* The current time (time.time()) is retrieved and converted into an integer seed.
* The random.seed() function initializes the random number generator with this seed, ensuring dynamic behavior across runs.
* A 128-bit key is generated by appending 16 random bytes (0â€“255) to a bytearray.
#### Case 2: Without a Seed

The random.seed(None) function resets the generator to its default state.
The 128-bit key is generated in the same way as in Case 1.
