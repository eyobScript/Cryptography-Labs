Observations and Purpose of random.seed()
Case 1 (Using Seed):

The generated key changes every time the program runs because the seed (based on the current time) is dynamic.
This ensures more randomness and unpredictability in the generated key.
Case 2 (Without Seed):

The results may vary depending on how the Python implementation handles the default seeding mechanism.
Without explicitly setting a seed, the behavior of the random number generator can be less consistent across runs.
Purpose of Functions:
time.time():
Provides a time-dependent value for seeding to ensure variability.
random.seed():
Initializes the random number generator with a specific seed.
Ensures reproducibility when using the same seed and dynamic randomness when using a time-based seed.
